His goal was to locate the remains of a city called Vitcos, the last capital of the Inca civilisation. Cusco lies on a high plateau at an elevation of more than 3,000 metres, and Bingham's plan was to descend from this plateau along the valley of the Urubamba river, which takes a circuitous route down to the Amazon and passes through an area of dramatic canyons and mountain ranges."

After walking for two hours, we discovered a hidden waterfall. It was amazing! We took many photos and had a picnic near the waterfall. In the afternoon, we returned home. It was the best day of my summer vacation."

She went to her room and returned with a small key. Sarah opened the box and found old photographs, letters, and a beautiful necklace. Her grandmother told her stories about each item. Sarah learned a lot about her family history that day."

We used different materials to make each planet look unique. On the day of the presentation, our model was the most colorful one in the class. The teacher was impressed and gave us an A. We were very proud of our work."
